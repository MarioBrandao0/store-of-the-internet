During Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidency, the United States saw itself as the strongest nation in the world, until Russia launched the Sputnik satellite, which generated fear and uncertainty about the Soviet capability to send more than just satellites, possibly even bombs. To avoid falling behind, Eisenhower sought out scientist Neil McElroy, requesting the creation of a new department to monitor technological advancements and prevent surprises. This initiated a technological race known as the Cold War, where scientists and engineers became the new "soldiers." Although McElroy believed American scientists were superior, Eisenhower wanted to ensure the nation stayed ahead, establishing a unified organization to coordinate high-tech efforts. This pursuit of control and innovation eventually led to the development of the internet.
